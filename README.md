This is my solution to the challenge given below. 

The pages I am referring to are hosted here:  http://marboro92.github.io/Optimization/

Testing page: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmarboro92.github.io%2FOptimization%2F&tab=desktop

FPS analysis done with Chrome Dev Tools

The Following changes were made to the home page (index.html) in order to acheive a page speed score of over 90 (according to google's page speed insights) on mobile and desktop devices:

1. JavaScript files have been given the async attribute to minimize CRP (Critical Rendering Path)
2. Google fonts were loaded with async js instead of css
3. Images were compressed and/or resized manually and using Gulp (found in img folder)
4. All necessary css was identified and inlined into html
5. Gulp was used to compress html and js files

The next task can be seen by clicking on the "Cam's Pizzeria" link in http://marboro92.github.io/Optimization/ or here http://marboro92.github.io/Optimization/views/pizza.html

The following changes were made to views/js/main.js in order to achieve 60fps and fix jank on the views/pizza.html page.

* more detailed comments can be seen in main.js

1. For loops were optimized by minimizing number of necessary iterations 
2. Variables that need not be defined on each iteration were removed from inside for loops
3. Variables that were global but referenced in only one function were moved into the local scope of that function
4. Unnecessary references to constant values as variables were removed and replaced by the corresponding constant value
5. Pizza slider was improved by optimizing the for loop within resizePizzas function and removing unnecessary iterations
6. TranslateX used instead of left in JS to animate pizza's, promoting pizzas to a new layer to minimize painting
7. Unchanging style elements were moved from js to css

ORGINAL CHALLENGE 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
